# ULL-WEAS
The code of Paper "Unsupervised Low-light Worker Ergonomics Assessment System".

The implementation is for non-commercial use only.

# Requirements
Python > 3.6

opencv

torchvision 0.2.1

# Test:

python test.py 

The script will process the images in the folders of "test" folder and the result will be in the "result" folder. 

(The training code will be given after the acceptance of the article)

We show some examples(darkpose with annotation) on https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xchengl_connect_ust_hk/EtszCastNjJMqFqvzmFBqxEBU1uwcU29QO8vh2haTCId8g?e=5nIFKA
